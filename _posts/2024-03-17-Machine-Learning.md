**Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** *(AI/ML)* represent a transformative area of computer science that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes learning from data, making decisions, and solving complex problems. AI acts as the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider *"smart,"* while ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to improve at tasks with experience. For instance, an AI-powered chatbot learns from interactions with users to provide better responses over time, demonstrating ML in action.
